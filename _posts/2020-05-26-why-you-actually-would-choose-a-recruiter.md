We typically hear a lot of questions about when people should work with a recruiter. Here are a few different examples.

One would be if you want to replace someone and do it confidentially. Another would be if you’ve exhausted all other methods in trying to fill a position and it’s just not yielding the results you’re looking for. Finally, if you have experience recruiting and need a specialist to assist you in placing the position, a recruiter can help there as well.

A specialist recruiter is going to have a good track record, a vast network, and they’re also going to call passive candidates. Based on that, they will pre-screen and pre-qualify all the individuals that they talk to, as well as interview them, do a back-channel reference, and come up with a short list of three to five people.&nbsp;

Once a candidate is selected, the recruiter will make the offer, ensure they resign from their current employer and don’t accept a counteroffer, and reach out graciously to those who didn’t get selected to preserve that relationship for future openings.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
