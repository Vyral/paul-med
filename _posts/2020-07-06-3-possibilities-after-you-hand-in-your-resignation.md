What happens after you hand in your resignation? There are three possibilities:

**1\. Your boss will say thank you.** Often they’ll say, “It’s been a pleasure having you work with us” or, “We’ve enjoyed your time here.” Something along these lines.

**2\. Your boss may ask you to stay.** They might ask if there’s anything they can do to keep you there. You should graciously say you’ve enjoyed your time there, but it’s time to move on.

**3\. Your boss may try to counteroffer.** They might say something like, “We don’t want you to leave; we need you. We’ll do everything within our power to keep you here.” Whether you feel good or insulted by the counteroffer, the only reason they offer this is to hold you long enough to find a great replacement. Don’t ever think they’re offering this for any other reason. Any time you’re given a counteroffer, gracefully decline.&nbsp;
