There are three types of searches a firm can hire a recruiter to conduct:

1. **Contingency search.** For this search, a recruiter is hired at the general rate of 25% of the first-year base salary. This search can be conducted with one recruiter exclusively or be given out to multiple recruiters at the same time.&nbsp;
2. **Retain search.** In this search, the recruiter is hired at 30% or 33% of the first year’s compensation, and usually, the retainer is paid up front, often over three payments, and a fourth payment is made upon a successful hire. This is commonly for mid-level to C-level type hires.
3. **Container.** A combination of both contingency and retain searches, this is for mid- to lower-level hires. However, because of the rarity of expertise or technicality that’s needed for a particular role, or due to geographical area, this requires a lot of up front research. So the firm and the recruiter will come to a compromise about whether they’ll be paid one third or one half of the first-year base salary or compensation. This will cover the cost of time, then they’ll be paid the balance upon the hire.&nbsp;
